# Minesweeper

Minesweeper game which uses an Arduino UNO compatible board (ATmega328p) to control a buzzer and display, with input from a joystick and two buttons. The joystick is used to navigates the game board, while the buttons mark cells as "clear" or "flagged." The goal is to reveal all safe cells; uncovering a mine ends the game with a buzzer sound signaling defeat, while leaving only mines triggers a victory sound.
